# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts housing prices in Boston using various features such as the number of rooms, crime rate, and property tax rate. It uses regression algorithms to forecast the **median value of owner-occupied homes** based on historical data.

This was one of my **first real-world ML projects**, built right after completing the **"Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification"** course by **Andrew Ng** on Coursera in **November 2023**. I applied the concepts learned to a more practical dataset from **Kaggle**.

## 🗂️ Dataset
- **Dataset**: Boston Housing Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- **Target Variable**: `MEDV` — Median house value (in $1000s)
- **Features include**:
  - `CRIM`: Crime rate
  - `RM`: Average number of rooms
  - `LSTAT`: % lower status of the population
  - `TAX`, `PTRATIO`, `DIS`, etc.
