# üéì Machine Learning & Deep Learning Projects ‚Äî Undergrad Portfolio

## üëã Hello!

Welcome to my curated portfolio of Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects, all built during my undergraduate journey (2023‚Äì2025) while pursuing B.E. in Electronics & Communication Engineering.

This repository is not just a list of projects ‚Äî it‚Äôs a story of consistent learning, passion, and perseverance.

## üìö My Learning Journey

In **November 2023**, at the beginning of my 5th semester, I completed the Coursera course *Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification* by Andrew Ng. That course sparked my hands-on journey into machine learning and data-driven modeling.

Since then, I‚Äôve taught myself:
- **Core ML Algorithms**: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees
- **Model Evaluation**: Underfitting, overfitting, bias-variance tradeoff
- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, OpenCV
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Git, OS module
- **Data Structures & Algorithms in Java**
- And implemented all of this into 9 self-driven projects

## üß† But Here‚Äôs What Matters Most:

> I worked on all of this **between external exams, internal exams, subject assignments, and academic deadlines** during my 4th to 8th semesters:
>
> - üìò **Oct 2023** ‚Äì 4th sem externals  
> - üìò **April 2024** ‚Äì 5th sem externals  
> - üìò **Aug 2024** ‚Äì 6th sem externals  
> - üìò **Jan 2025** ‚Äì 7th sem externals  
> - üìò **May 2025** ‚Äì 8th sem externals  

Despite being academically occupied, I pursued my deep interest in machine learning and deep learning. It wasn‚Äôt always easy ‚Äî but my **passion and curiosity never stopped**. This repo is a reflection of that drive.

## üíº Why This Repo?

This repository reflects my ability to:
- Learn independently
- Apply concepts to real-world problems
- Stay consistent even under academic pressure
- Build a strong foundation in machine learning and deep learning

Each project here represents a milestone in my undergraduate research journey and my long-term commitment to contributing to the field of artificial intelligence.

## üå± What's Next?

I am currently advancing through my **deep learning journey**, focusing on both foundational theory and practical implementation. This includes exploring specialized architectures such as **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**, and the principles behind **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

As I continue learning, I will document future projects and experiments in a separate repository dedicated to deep learning.

## üôè Final Note

Thank you for taking the time to explore this repository.

These projects were built with care, often between tight academic deadlines, and they reflect my passion and long-term dedication to learning, building, and contributing meaningfully to the field of machine learning and deep learning.
